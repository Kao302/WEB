    <h1>Life in Amsterdam</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>Living and working in Amsterdam is a wonderful experience. The city has a<br> high quality of life, with ubiquitous bikes making getting around easy, a<br> vibrant cultural scene, and plenty of time to enjoy it all, as the Netherlands<br> is known for its good work-life balance and high standards in<br> education, healthcare, and family life.</p>

    <div class="dish1"><h1>Bitterballen</h1>
    <p>
      So you went out for a few drinks. You forgot to eat dinner. Those 8% Belgian beers are beginning to take their toll. What to do? The answer is in the bitterballen. Delicious, deep fried crispy meatballs traditionally served with mustard for dipping. 
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="dish2"><h1>Stroopwafel</h1>
    <p>If you try one Dutch sweet treat, make it a stroopwafel. Two thin waffles stuck together with a layer of sweet syrup; these delectable delicacies are best enjoyed hot and gooey from a street market or bakery.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="dish3"><h1>Raw herring</h1>
    <p>Raw herring may sound a little scary to the uninitiated, but every visitor to Amsterdam should give it a go. You’ll spot haringhandels (herring carts) serving up this Dutch speciality all over the city - ask for a ‘broodje haring’ to get the fish served in a small sandwich with pickles and onions.</p>
  </div>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="subtitle2"><h1>Culture</h1></div>
<div class="culture">
  <div class="culture1"><h1>Religion and Spirituality</h1>
    <p>While Christianity was traditionally the predominant religion in the Netherlands (and memories of Calvinism still have an influence on various aspects of culture and daily life), there are now more Dutch people identifying as non-religious than as Christians.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="culture2"><h1>Diversity in the city</h1>
    <p>With 180 different nationalities, Amsterdam’s population is one of the most diverse in Europe. Over the last 50 years, the city has seen an influx of people from countries and cultures around the world, and has welcomed large numbers from Suriname, Turkey and Morocco.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="culture3"><h1>Dutch culture</h1>
    <p>The Dutch are, above all, pragmatic people. They live life unburdened by the usual rituals that bog down other cultures. That means you can trust a Dutchie to tell it like it really is and always stand firm on a matter.</p>
